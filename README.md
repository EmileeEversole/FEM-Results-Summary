### What I learned

This is my second Frontend Mentor challenge, so I felt that I had a better understanding of the file formats, which helped a lot; it's easier to complete the project when you understand the files! In relation to the code, I definitely think I'm seeing the beginnings of developing that "think ahead" skill that I mentioned in my first project, so I don't have to go back and edit so much. That skill is very much still in development, but I'm excited to continue working towards it! 

I estimated that this project would take approximately 3 hours to complete, but it took closer to 4. My biggest (unnecessary) time-consumers were stopping to revise or find the cause of a layout error. 

### Continued development

As mentioned above, I will continue to work on learning to look at the project as a whole, rather than only in bits and pieces, so I can think ahead and save myself time/effort when I'm revising. 

I was about an hour off on my time-estimation, so I definitely need to continue to develop my time-estimation skills, and work on my efficiency as a whole.
